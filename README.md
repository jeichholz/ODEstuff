# ODEstuff

This is where I intend to put custom functions that we create for the ODE modeling project. For example, in Matlab it is not easy to solve a system of equations for y''(t), because matlab is surprisingly stupid.  I wrote a function esolve that does a little trickery to get Matlab to do it.  So, just convenience things. Also included here should be code examples of nice problems.
